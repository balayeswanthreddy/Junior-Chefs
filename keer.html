            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <li>1/2 cup roasted vermicelli (semiya)</li> 
            <li>4 cups milk</li>  
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li> 
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>A handful of cashews and raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>A few strands of crushed almonds for garnish </li>
       </ul>
       <pre>
       1.Heat ghee in a deep pan or pot. If using, fry cashews and raisins 
          until golden brown. Set them aside.
       2.In the same pan,add the roasted vermicelli.Roast it on low to 
         medium heat until it turns golden brown and aromatic.Keep  
         stirring to ensure even roasting and to prevent burning.
       3.Once the vermicelli is roasted, add milk to the pan. Stir well  
         and bring it to a gentle boil.
       4.Reduce the heat to low and let the vermicelli cook in the milk 
         until it becomes soft. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking to  
         the bottom of the pan.
       5.Once the vermicelli is cooked and the milk has thickened slightly, 
         add sugar and cardamom powder. Stir well until the sugar is
         dissolved.
       6.If using saffron strands, crush them and soak them in a tablespoon  
         of warm milk. Add this saffron-infused milk to the payasam for  
         a rich color and aroma.
       7.Add the fried cashews and raisins to the payasam and mix well.
       8.Let the payasam simmer for a few more minutes on low heat to allow 
         all the flavors to blend together.
       9.Once done, turn off the heat.
       10.Garnish with crushed pistachios or almonds, if desired.

              Your delicious Semiya Payasam is ready to be served.
