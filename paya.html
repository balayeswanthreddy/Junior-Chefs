       <pre>
       1.Wash the mutton trotters thoroughly under running water.
       2.Soak them in water for at least 2-3 hours or overnight to 
         remove any impurities and to soften them.
       3.In a large pot or pressure cooker, add the soaked mutton paya 
         along with enough water to cover them.
       4.Add salt, turmeric powder, and half of the chopped onions.
       5.Cook the trotters until they are tender and almost falling off 
         the bones. This may take about 1 to 1.5 hours in a regular pot or 
         6-8 whistles in a pressure cooker.  
      ->Preparing the Gravy:
       1.In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee.
       2.Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
       3.Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies.Sauté for a 
         few minutes until the raw smell disappears.
       4.Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn mushy.
       5.Lower the heat and add red chilipowder,corianderpowder,and 
         garam masalapowder.Mix well and cook the spices for a few minutes.
      ->Combining with Cooked paya
       1.Once the paya are cooked,add them along with their cooking liquid 
         to the pan with the onion-tomato mixture.
       2.Mix well and let it simmer for another 20-30 minutes, allowing the 
         flavors to meld together.
       3.If the gravy is too thick,add some water to adjust the consistency.
       4.Garnish the Mutton Paya with fresh coriander leaves.
