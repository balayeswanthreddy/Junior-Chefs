        Prepare the pizza dough:
        1.In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water. Let it sit 
          for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        2.In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in 
          the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
        3.Mix until the dough forms.If it's too sticky,add bit more flour; 
         if it's too dry, add a bit more water.
        4.Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until 
          it's smooth and elastic.
        5.Place the dough in a greased bowl,cover it with a kitchen towel, 
          and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until 
          it doubles in size.
        Make the pizza sauce:
        1.In a saucepan,combine crushed tomatoes,minced garlic,dried oregano, 
          dried basil, salt, and pepper.
        2.Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring 
          occasionally, until it thickens slightly. 
        3.Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go.If you have
          a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.  
       ->Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into portions 
         Assemble the pizza
       ->Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.Add toppings
       ->Move the assembled pizza to the preheated oven.Bake for about 10min
       ->Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes 
         before slicing and serving.
